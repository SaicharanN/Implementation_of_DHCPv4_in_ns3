DHCP In ns3


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host
with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.

While DHCPv4 has been implemented in ns3, Some of the options are still unavailable in the implemented version.

Some of the options can be still impemented.
RFC 2132 defines DHCP Options for dynamic configuration of IPv addresses on hosts.  
We will implement some of the options here.
